# Setting Up a TIL Repository

I learned how to create and structure a Today I Learned (TIL) repository on GitHub, inspired by Simon Willison's approach.

## Details

Key steps I learned:
- Created basic repository structure with topic-based folders
- Set up an Issue to track setup progress
- Learned two ways to create folders:
  1. Through GitHub web interface
  2. Via local Mac using Git commands
- Established a standard format for TIL entries (This was suggested by Claude, but haven't internalized it yet so am just copy-pasting)
